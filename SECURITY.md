# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please create a [security advisory](https://github.com/dsccommunity/relabeler-action/security/advisories).
Then please make @johlju aware that you created a security advisory. The easiest way to do so is to send a
direct message via Twitter or Slack.
